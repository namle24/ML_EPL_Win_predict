# ML-Premier-League-Wins-Predictor
This project is a simulation so the prediction result is not correct

## Overview
ML-Premier-League-Wins-Predictor is my first machine learning project that predicts the number of wins for each team in the Premier League using linear regression. Explore the key factors that contribute to becoming a champion in one of the world's most competitive football leagues. Jupyter Notebook and code included.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes several datasets related to the Premier League:

- results.csv: Contains information about all the match results in the Premier League between the 2006/07 season and the 2017/18 season.
- stats.csv: Expands on the statistical categories that are official for the Premier League and will be used for analysis.
- EPL standings 2000-2022.csv: Provides the standings of the individual teams throughout the seasons 2000-2022.
- with_goalscorers.csv: Provides the top goalscorers from the formation of the Premier League in 1992 until now.

## Problem Statement
The main goal of this project is to build regression model to predict the number of wins for each team in a Premier League season. Additionally, we want to identify the key factors that contribute to a team becoming a champion. By doing so, we aim to gain insights into what makes a team successful in the Premier League.

## Results
After running , you will obtain insights into the factors that influence a team's success in the Premier League. The linear regression model will provide predictions for the number of wins, and feature importance analysis will highlight the key factors that contribute to becoming a champion.
